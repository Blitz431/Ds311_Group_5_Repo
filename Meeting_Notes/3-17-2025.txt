Discussion Summary:

Project Requirements & Questions Selection

The project requires selecting three provided questions and formulating three original questions for analysis.

Selected questions from the project:

Question 2: Identify the strongest team based on defense, midfield, and offense scores. (Assigned to Aarnav Saxena)

Question 3: Determine if home-team advantage is a real factor. (Assigned to Saajay Singh)

Question 5: Analyze the longest winning streak using Tableau. (Assigned to Shaun Kumar – pending Tableau setup)

Original Question Brainstorming

Discussion on possible new questions:

Examining whether a higher defensive score correlates with winning more games.

More questions will be decided over time as knowledge of Tableau and other tools improves.

Decision:

Members will propose additional questions in the group chat.

Final questions will be assigned similarly to the first three.
